ent-EdgeDetector = edge detector
    .desc = Splits rising and falling edges into unique pulses and detects how edgy you are.
ent-PowerSensor = power sensor
    .desc = Generates signals in response to powernet changes. Can be cycled between cable voltages.
ent-MemoryCell = memory cell
    .desc = A D-Latch circuit that stores a signal which can be changed depending on input and enable ports.
